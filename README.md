# Weight-Class-BMI-Calculator
The program that inspired me to lose weight. So I built it a calculator that calculates the total BMI based on height (inches) and weight.

### What I've learned
- using a while loop to continuously run the program even after the total BMI has been presented to request more user input.
- calculating the Body Mass Index based on the total amount of inches in height and weight size the user puts in.
- using the cmath library to deliver the calculation of any random integer.
- eat less sugar and stay healthy in order to keep the weight off, lol! Focus on the BMI; not the weight! :)

#### Code that calculates the height and weight to get the Body Mass Index result

```C+
  	const double INCH_TO_CM = 2.54;
	const double POUNDS_TO_GM = 453.59;
```

### How it works!
- Download the release version in .ZIP or .TAR.GZ to extract the files or simply download the .EXE in the repository. Enjoy! :)

### Here's an example
